Honestly last seven lectures are good. Lectures are understandable. Lecture sides are very useful to self-study also. The given opportunity to ask questions from the lecturer is appreciative. 
"Good :)

<br />He can hear your voice clearly and can understand the things you teach. Presentation sides also good source to refer . of you can do more example questions within the classroom and it will help us to understand the principles well.

Lectures was well structures and well organized. It was easy to understand. Lecture sides and laws were also well organized. 
Lectures were good. understandable. 
The lecture sides were well organized and the examples done in the class helped a lot to learn this new language and also the principles of OOP. Motivate to well. Would have been better if we discussed more about the solutions of coming exercises.   
I think i learned a lot from the codes you write in the board. When i compare my codes with yours i can learn about my mistakes and good coming practices that i should follow. There fore i think it would be great if we can discuss more examples in the class.
madam explained  the top concepts clearly with examples.lectures were interesting.we want more scenario examples and answers with explanations in future.
I satisfy about first 7 lectures. That way of teaching is really good for coming lectures too.
lectures are very good. take good effort to make understand every student in the room. very helpful. 
I was able to obtain a clear picture about OOP and its concepts. 
"lecture sides, explanations were very clear.
<br />it&#039;s very good to letting ask questions and explain again with suitable examples.
<br />sometimes, some codes on white board were unclear at the back.
<br />overall very good!!!
<br />"
The lectures were good and clear. And they weren&#039;t too fast. Writing code was somewhat confusing because I didn&#039;t know cava before. 
Actually teaching is very good and can understand easily the concepts by examples which are given in the class.it will be more helpful if provide solved questions as well!. thankyou
